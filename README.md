# **Meme Generator**

## ABOUT

Hey there! This is my second project. This time I'm doing a meme generator. The idea of this project is to work with js and document events. So, I applied the knowledge of HTML and CSS that I had from last couple of months plus JavaScript knowledge, to do a funny meme website.

## WEBSITE STRUCTURE

### âœ¦ Header

The header has a title and a list of buttons: _Image:_ to display the image panel settings, _Text:_ to display the text panel settings and _Dark mode:_ to switch between light and dark mode.

### âœ¦ Meme container

In the middle we can find a container with a black background and two titles. In this container will affect what we do with settings panels.

### âœ¦ Settings Panels

We have two settings panels: Image and Text.
On each one I brought the elements to the script file to add the event listeners. Each one with their own function.

## KNOWLEDGE APPLIED

### âœ¦ HTML

A simple structure with the labels header, main and aside. Using forms and input labels for settings, so the user can customize the meme.

### âœ¦ CSS

I used Flex-box and the property position to display the elements. It loads on dark mode as default but there is a switch button on the header that allows you to view the website on light mode as well.
For the meme, as long as DOM doesn't work with img label I use div and background-image property to be able to download the content of the container.

### âœ¦ JavaScript

The mail goal for this project was use JavaScript language and be capable of capturing events through inputs that modify one container(the meme).
To practice using DOM I create functions that works with the meme container making changes on the style of the elements, like background-image, innerText.
I could learn to use the differents events like 'input' and 'click'.

## HOW TO USE IT

### âœ¦ Apply an image

Just need to copy and paste an image link on the url input at the image panel. Make sure it doesn't have any copyright because there is a chance it wont work depending on the link you use.

### âœ¦ Filters

Yo can put a background color and give an overlay for it. Also apply filters to the image-background. If you want to start from 0, just need to click the reset button on the bottom.

### âœ¦ Text

If you go to the text panel (through the button at the header) you can write your own text on the inputs. Also you cand hide them, give transparent background, or any color that you want. You can choose the font style, padding, leading and everything to customize your meme.

### âœ¦ Download

At the bottom of the page you have a green button, just need to press to download your meme!
